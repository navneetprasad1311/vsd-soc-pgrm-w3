# *Week 3* VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program ![GLS & STA](https://img.shields.io/badge/GLS_%26_STA_of_VSDBabySoC-Done-darkgreen)

`05/10/2025` to `11/10/2025`

This documentation covers all the topics required to build a solid understanding of Static Timing Analysis (STA) using OpenSTA and practice performing accurate timing verification of digital designs, including setup and hold checks, slack analysis, and PVT corner evaluation. It provides hands-on guidance for running STA using TCL scripts, inline commands, and SPEF-based analysis to ensure robust and reliable timing of designs like `example1.v` and `VSDBabySoC`.

## Objectives

- Develop a solid understanding of **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** concepts, including setup and hold checks, slack, and critical path identification.  

- Gain hands-on experience performing STA using **OpenSTA**, including reading Liberty files, netlists, and SDC constraints.  

- Learn to analyze timing reports, including min/max path delays, WNS, TNS, and hold/setup violations.  

- Understand the workflow for timing verification from design netlist to timing report, including SPEF-based parasitic analysis.  

- Prepare for **pre-silicon validation** steps, including PVT corner analysis and ensuring timing closure for robust and reliable operation.
